      Envision a second-year student captivated by a YouTube video on <span className='font-medium text-blue-500'>web development</span>â€”a pivotal moment in my journey at <span className='font-medium text-blue-500'>GITAM University, Bangalore.</span> From that spark, I embarked on a relentless pursuit of knowledge, devouring front-end tutorials and embracing formal education with <span className='font-medium text-blue-500'>Meta's</span> Coursera course. Crafting websites became my passion, leading me to serve on the <span className='font-medium text-blue-500'>UI/UX design team</span>  in my college's vibrant GitHub community. Beyond screens, I find inspiration in pushing boundaries at the gym, liberating bike rides, kitchen experiments, and untamed treks. As a fourth-year BTech student, I'm eager to transition into professional web development, ready to infuse enthusiasm and skills into creating impactful digital experiences.
