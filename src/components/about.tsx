        Imagine a second-year student, stumbling upon a 
        <span className="font-medium"> YouTube video about web development</span> 
        and being instantly captivated. That was me, at a pivotal moment in my academic journey at 
        <span className="font-medium"> GITAM University, Bangalore.</span>
        From that serendipitous encounter, I've been on an unyielding quest for knowledge. I delved into YouTube playlists, 
        devouring front-end development tutorials with fervor. Soon after, I eagerly embraced formal education, enrolling in 
        <span> Meta's front-end development</span> course on Coursera. Online learning became my ally, guiding me through the labyrinth of full-stack development.
        The art of crafting websites, meticulously weaving code and design, became my fervent passion. I proudly serve as a member of the 
        <span className="font-medium"> UI/UX design team</span> in my college's vibrant <span className="font-medium"> GitHub community</span>.
        Beyond the screens and code editors, I find inspiration in diverse pursuits. From pushing boundaries at the gym to liberating bike rides, 
        from experimenting in the kitchen to exploring untamed trails during treksâ€”these experiences fuel my creativity and zest for life.
        Fourth-year BTech student at GITAM University, Bangalore. Eager to transition into web development professionally. 
        Ready to bring enthusiasm and skills to create impactful digital experiences.
